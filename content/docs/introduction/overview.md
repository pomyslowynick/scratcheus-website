# Scratcheus: Build Prometheus from the scratch!

----

This is a lengthy tutorial documenting my adventure in recreating Prometheus from the scratch, using the available source code, books, articles and papers.

I find that the mix of theory reading and light attempts at implementing has the highest ROI in terms of learning and retaining information. 

So please, join in me on this adventure, let's make it fun to learn things and hopefully you'll gain more understanding of how Prometheus works under the hood!
