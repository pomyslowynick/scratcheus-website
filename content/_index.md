This is a lengthy tutorial documenting my adventure in recreating Prometheus from scratch, using the source code, books, articles and papers.

I find that the mix of theory reading and light attempts at implementing said theory has the highest ROI in terms of learning and retaining information. 

So please, join in me on this adventure, let's make it fun to learn things and hopefully you'll gain more understanding of how Prometheus works under the hood!

This project is composed of sequential chapters in which you implement more and more of Prometheus components, it doesn't aim to be complete but only functional enough to show the basic concepts. Repository with a branch for each chapter can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/pomyslowynick/scratcheus).
